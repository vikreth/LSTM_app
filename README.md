# Usage
The LSTM model is used to perform sentiment analysis on movie reviews. It is trained using the IMDB dataset with 50,000 movie reviews (25,000 for training and 25,000 for testing). You can try it out yourself by running the app.py script after installing the required packages.

Once you run app.py, it will prompt you to input a movie review. After that, it will use the LSTM model to predict whether the review is positive or negative.
